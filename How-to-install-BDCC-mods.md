# Where to get mods
For now the only source of mods is the game's discord

[BDCC discord link](https://discord.gg/7UGYBvQrc3)

Mods are simple zip archives. Don't unpack them

Keep in mind that some mods NEED to be updated for each new version of a game. If the game crashes on start, remove mods

# Windows/linux/mac
1) Open the game
2) Press 'Mods'
3) Press 'Open mods folder' or go to `%appdata%/Godot/app_userdata/BDCC/mods` folder
4) Copy the zip files into that folder
5) Restart the game, mods should appear

# Android
1) Open the game
2) Press 'Mods'
3) If the game asks for external storage permissions, you gotta accept
4) Press 'Import mod' button. Game should tell you where to store mods on your device. It's usually the `documents/BDCCMods` folder
5) Copy `BDCC.pck` file into that folder. Warning. You will need to update this file with the new ones after each game update or stuff will crash
6) Copy the zip files into that folder
7) Restart the game. There should be a BDCC.pck file loaded as mod and you should also see other mods

If you don't do Step 5 the game will crash! Limitation of godot engine. `BDCC.pck` file can be downloaded separately from itch/github releases

# HTML5
1) Open the game
2) Press 'Mods'
3) Press 'Import mod'. Select the zip file
4) Reload the page. Mod should show up

Be very careful with mods and HTML5 version. If the mod crashes the game, your only option is to clear your localstorage. That will also delete your saves!
