You can think about datapacks like small mods that can be created inside the game without you having to use the big clunky Godot Editor.

They're easy to make and don't require coding knowledge. But they're also heavily limited compared to mods.

Here is what you can create with datapacks:
- Custom dynamic characters
- New skins
- New scenes (not yet, maybe in the future)

Skins that are added through datapacks are always avaiable. But to make custom dynamic characters appear in your save, you gotta go to the `Pause menu -> Datapacks -> Press 'load' on the datapack`. After that, all the characters that this datapack has will be added into your current save. To get rid of them, you can press `'unload'` in the same menu.
