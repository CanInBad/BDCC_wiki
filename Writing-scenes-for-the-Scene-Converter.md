Scene converter is a powerful tool that allows you turn scenes written in google docs into working code in two clicks as long as you follow the format that's outlined here. This saves time both for you (the writer) and the coder, eliminating the boring task of manually translating text into code. It also allows you to preview the scene inside the game.

What do you need:
- A text editor of your choice. I strongly recommend google docs as it catches most of the typos and grammatical errors while being free and widely used.
- Game.

Example of a simple scene:

```
sceneID=MyTestScene

! addCharacter(“rahi”)
! playAnimation(StageScene.Duo, “stand”, {npc=”rahi”})

Rahi enters the room.

=rahi: Hi, {pc.name}! I'm Rahi!

[[Wave hand, Do a friendly gesture, wave_hand]]
[[Pat cat, Pat Rahi on the head, pat_rahi]]

> wave_hand
You wave your hand.

=pc: Hello Rahi.

[[Continue, This will end the scene, endthescene]]

> pat_rahi
You pat Rahi. She purrs.

[[Continue, This will end the scene, endthescene]]

```

To preview this scene, copy it into the scene converter, then press Convert and then Test Scene.

First line defines the id of this scene. This id must be unique across all scenes in the game. No spaces allowed `sceneID=<SCENE_ID_HERE>`

Lines that begin with `!` are gdscript code that will be executed at the same time when this section is shown. The first line will add Rahi into the nearby characters list. The second line will show the doll of Rahi standing near yours. Keep in mind that this code will be executed each time this section of the scene is shown. That means don't add code that effects the game's state there (like adding pain to the player for example) or these effects will be executed multiple times. The way to run code only once will be shown later.

Character's dialogue must always be on the new line and start with a `=` symbol followed by the character's id followed by a `:` symbol and then the text that the character says. If you wanna speak as the player, use `pc` for id. `=pc: Hello, Rahi!`

The commands like `{pc.name}` will be parsed and replaced automatically when the scene is shown. You can find most of the parser commands below.

Lines that start with `[[` and end with `]]` are options/buttons. The syntax is as follows: `[[BUTTON_TEXT, DESCRIPTION, ACTION_ID]]`. Action id is basically the section that you will jump to when pressing that button. To start a new section use `> SECTION_ID`.

`endthescene` is a special action id that is always available. It will end the scene. `[[Continue, See what happens next, endthescene]]`

# Parser commands
Parser commands are the special tags that will be automatically replaced when the scene is shown. Example is `{pc.name}`

They usually start with the character id (pc is player's id), followed a command. Sometimes the command requires arguments that you pass like you would pass an arguments to function in a normal coding language. `{pc.you} {pc.youVerb('take'}} something`

Most commands work for both player and npcs but not everything.
